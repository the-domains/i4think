### A theory of consciousness

* An evolutionary tool to allow people to evolve more complex structures = greater complexity in the universe
* Purpose is a necessary factor of consciousness, because it gives something for people to strive towards, a way to use their consciousness
* Purpose is intrinsically linked to social good and benefit --- this allows societies to thrive further rather than reverting into individualist anarchy.
* Individual benefit must sit within the larger context of social benefit. That is why very few people are capable of existing without others, and that self fulfilling goals with outside recognition are very seldom followed through on.
* Purpose is continually rewritten throughout life to provide more and more worthwhile goals to work towards.
